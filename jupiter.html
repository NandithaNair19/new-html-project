        size and distinctive appearance,characterized by its colorful bands of clouds and the Great Red Spot—a giant storm that
        has been raging for centuries.It is a gas giant composed mainly of hydrogen and helium,with no solid surface.Jupiter 
        has a strong magnetic field and is surrounded by at least 79 moons,including the four largest—Io,Europa,Ganymede,and
        Callisto,known as the Galilean moons.The planet has a very fast rotation,completing a full spin in just under 10 hours.
        Jupiter's immense gravity plays a significant role in protecting the inner solar system by deflecting comets and
        asteroids. With its stunning rings,powerful storms,and many moons,Jupiter remains one of the most fascinating and 
        mysterious planets to explore.<br></p>
