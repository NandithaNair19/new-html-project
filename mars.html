        to as the "Red Planet" due to its reddish appearance,which is caused by iron oxide,or rust,on its surface.
        It has a thin atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide,with traces of nitrogen and argon.Mars is home to the 
        tallest volcano in the solar system,Olympus Mons,and a large canyon,Valles Marineris,which stretches over 4,000 
        kilometers.While it is too cold and dry for liquid water to exist on its surface today,evidence suggests that Mars 
        may have once had flowing rivers and lakes.Mars has two small moons,Phobos and Deimos,which are thought to be captured 
        asteroids.With its similarities to Earth,Mars is a prime target for exploration and potential future human colonization.<br></p>
