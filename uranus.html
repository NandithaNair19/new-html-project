    <p ><font face="ariel" size="5.5"  color="white">Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is known for its
        striking blue-green color which is caused by methane gas in its atmosphere.It is an ice giant,composed mostly of water,
        ammonia,and methane ice,with a rocky core.Uranus has a unique tilt,rotating on its side at an angle of about 98 degrees,
        which means its poles are nearly in the plane of its orbit.This gives it extreme seasons,with each pole experiencing 21
        years of continuous sunlight followed by 21 years of darkness.Uranus has a faint ring system and 27 known moons,
        with Miranda,Ariel,and Titania being the largest. It takes 84 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun.<br></p>
