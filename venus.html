    <p ><font face="ariel" size="5.5"  color="white" >Venus is the second planet from the Sun and often called Earth's "sister 
        planet" due to its similar size and mass. However, despite its similarities, Venus has a harsh environment. It has a 
        thick atmosphere made mostly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, creating an extreme greenhouse effect. 
        This causes surface temperatures on Venus to be hotter than Mercury, despite being fartherfrom the Sun. The planet 
        rotates in the opposite direction to most planets in the solar system, making its day longer than its year.
        Venus also has no moons, and its surface is characterized by volcanic plains, highland regions, and vast impact craters.</p>
